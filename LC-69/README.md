# LC-69 - Sqrt(x)

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of `x`, where `x` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

## Examples

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

```
