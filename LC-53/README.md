# LC-53 - Maximum Subarray

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

> * Difficulty: **EASY**

## Examples

```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

## Follow Up

If you have figured out the $O(n)$ solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
