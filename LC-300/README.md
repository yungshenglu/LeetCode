## Example

```
Input: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4.
```

## Note

* There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
* Your algorithm should run in $O(n^2)$ complexity.

## Follow Up

* Could you improve it to $O(n \log{n})$ time complexity?
